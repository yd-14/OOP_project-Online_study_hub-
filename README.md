Tutor’s Corner is a web-based study material sharing and management system which helps students and teachers to share their study material online effectively. It reduces the wasting of time in manually distributing notes and books to each individual. It greatly overcomes the lack of availability and converts the manual old school paperwork to a fully automated and managed online system. 

 Tutor’s Corner allows its users to securely register and log in to their accounts and create, read, update, delete notes, books and other study material according to their needs. It provides study material to everyone in a very secure manner. Multiple users can work in this system at the same time under centralized supervision by the administrator. It is a very useful study material management system for Colleges, Schools and other Institutes to manage and share their notes in a secure, efficient and effective manner.
